## INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN SYSTEMS

wget -O - http://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key| apt-key add - # Import our signing key
echo 'deb http://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list # Create an Apt sources.list file
aptitude update -y # Find out about the files in our repository
aptitude install neo4j -y # Install Neo4j, community edition
            
You could replace stable with testing if you want a newer (but unsupported) build of Neo4j. If you'd like a different edition, you can run:
apt-get install neo4j-advanced, or
apt-get install neo4j-enterprise
When you install neo4j-enterprise you will also get neo4j-arbiter.
